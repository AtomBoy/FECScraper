This code is part of a web application to analyze campaign finance data on
http://www.atomodo.com which is still being written.

There is a great set of data about who gives money to US political committees. 
It is maintained by the Federal Elections Commission and is free to
download from an ftp server at ftp://ftp.fec.gov .

Anyone wanting to do serious analysis on this data will face a couple of
challenges- it's pretty big data and the ids that you might expect to be able
to use are not always unique across years.

This script fetches files from the ftp server and efficiently loads the data
into a MySQL database. It uses unique, database generated, integer keys for
efficient joins.

Before running the script, you should create a database using the
CREATE_FEC_DATABASE.sql script. Once the database is created, you'll need to
add a user with SELECT, INSERT, CREATE, and DROP permissions, then edit
src/atomodo/fecscraper/DBModel.groovy to update the username and password on
line 26. You should also update the email address on line 28 of
src/atomodo/fecscraper/FTPModel.groovy to your own.

To compile, you'll need Groovy 1.6 or greater, commons.net 3.0.1,
mysql connector 5.1, and commons.compress 1.4.1+.
