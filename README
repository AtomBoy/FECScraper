There is a great set of data about who gives money to US political committees. 
It is maintained by the Federal Elections Commission and is free to
download from an ftp server at ftp://ftp.fec.gov .

Anyone wanting to do serious analysis on this data will face a couple of
challenges- it's pretty big data and the ids that you might expect to be able
to use are not always unique across years.

This script fetches files from the ftp server and efficently loads the data
into a MySQL database. It uses unique, database generated, integer keys for
efficient joins.
